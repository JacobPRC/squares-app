# Squares

MERN stack savings app based on the square savings on N26 bank

## About
Inspired by, but not a direct clone of, the squares savings functionality from the N26 bank app, this MERN stack app allows users to deposit money into their account, then create spaces for various savings goals that the user can deposit their funds into.

### Motivation

I wanted to build another MERN stack app, but something different than the other MERN apps I had built. I really love N26 and their app functionality, so I tried to, in a very basic sense, replicate their square savings. 

## Built With:

### Front End

React <br />
Apollo-Client <br />

### Back End

Node.js <br />
Express <br />
Mongoose <br />
Express-GraphQL
